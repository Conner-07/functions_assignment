probability associted with rolling those dice and achieving a number that is greater than or equal to a number that is determined by the first arguemnt
The second function takes a string of letters from the useres and determine all possibe permutations**
What does this program take as input? **Both functions are contingent on arguments provided by the user**
What is the expected out put of the program? **The probability of a certain configuration of dice roll when being added being equal to or greater than a certain sum, as well as the number 
of possible permutations for a provided string.**
What type of execution is included in your program? **Both sequential and conditional**
How could your program be improved?
